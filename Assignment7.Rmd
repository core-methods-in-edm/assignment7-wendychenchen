In the following assignment you will be looking at data from an one level of an online geography tutoring system used by 5th grade students. The game involves a pre-test of geography knowledge (pre.test), a series of assignments for which you have the average score (av.assignment.score),  the number of messages sent by each student to other students about the assignments (messages), the number of forum posts students posted asking questions about the assignment (forum.posts), a post test at the end of the level (post.test) and whether or not the system allowed the students to go on to the next level (level.up).  

#Upload data
```{r}
D1 <- read.csv("online.data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
D1$level.up<-ifelse(D1$level.up=="no",0,1)

```

#Visualization 
```{r}
#Start by creating histograms of the distributions for all variables (#HINT: look up "facet" in the ggplot documentation)
#first transfer to long form
D2<-tidyr::gather(D1,"variable","value",2:7)
D2<-dplyr::select(D2,2:3)
#package
library(ggplot2)

#histogram
hist1 = ggplot(D2,aes(x=value)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free")
##Note, remember to ask how to scale the x axis?? why do my post.test.score and pre.test.score look so weird
#Then visualize the relationships between variables

#Try to capture an intution about the data and the relationships （that is the correlation ）
COR <- cor(D1)
library(corrplot)
corrplot(COR, order="AOE", method= "circle", tl.pos="lt", type="upper", tl.col="black", tl.cex=0.6, tl.srt=45, 
        addCoef.col="black", addCoefasPercent = TRUE,
        sig.level=0.50, insig = "blank")

```
#Classification tree
```{r}
#Create a classification tree that predicts whether a student "levels up" in the online course using three variables of your choice (As we did last time, set all controls to their minimums)
library(rpart)
c.tree1 <-  rpart(level.up ~ av.assignment.score + post.test.score+forum.posts, method="class", data=D1, control=rpart.control(minsplit = 1,minbucket = 1,cp=0.001))

#Plot and generate a CP table for your tree 
post(c.tree1, file = "tree1.ps", title = "levelup: 1 - yes, 2 - no")

printcp(c.tree1)
#   CP nsplit rel error xerror     xstd
#1 0.930      0      1.00   1.00 0.038730
#2 0.070      1      0.07   0.07 0.013042
#3 0.001      2      0.00   0.00 0.000000

#Generate a probability value that represents the probability that a student levels up based your classification tree 

D1$pred <- predict(c.tree1, type = "prob")[,2]#Last class we used type = "class" which predicted the classification for us, this time we are using type = "prob" to see the probability that our classififcation is based on.

#Now you can generate the ROC curve for your model. You will need to install the package ROCR to do this.

library(ROCR)

#Plot the curve
pred.detail <- prediction(D1$pred, D1$level.up) 
plot(performance(pred.detail, "tpr", "fpr"))
abline(0, 1, lty = 2)

#Calculate the Area Under the Curve
unlist(slot(performance(Pred,"auc"), "y.values"))#Unlist liberates the AUC value from the "performance" object created by ROCR

#Now repeat this process, but using the variables you did not use for the previous model and compare the plots & results of your two models. Which one do you think was the better model? Why?
c.tree2 <-  rpart(level.up ~ messages + pre.test.score, method="class", data=D1, control=rpart.control(minsplit = 1,minbucket = 1,cp=0.001))

#Plot and generate a CP table for your tree 
post(c.tree2, file = "tree2.ps", title = "levelup: 1 - yes, 2 - no")

printcp(c.tree2)

#Generate a probability value that represents the probability that a student levels up based your classification tree 

D1$pred2 <- predict(c.tree2, type = "prob")[,2]#Last class we used type = "class" which predicted the classification for us, this time we are using type = "prob" to see the probability that our classififcation is based on.

##now the predict columns are in percentage!!!!! why did that happpen really confused..

#Now you can generate the ROC curve for your model. You will need to install the package ROCR to do this.

library(ROCR)

#Plot the curve
pred.detail2<- prediction(D1$pred2, D1$level.up) 
plot(performance(pred.detail2, "tpr", "fpr"))
abline(0, 1, lty = 2)
#Calculate the Area Under the Curve
unlist(slot(performance(pred.detail2,"auc"), "y.values"))#Unlist liberates the AUC value from the "performance" object created by ROCR
```


#Thresholds
```{r}
#Look at the ROC plot for your first model. Based on this plot choose a probability threshold that balances capturing the most correct predictions against false positives. Then generate a new variable in your data set that classifies each student according to your chosen threshold.
#for the first prediction, we seem to chose the perfect factors which make an 100% correct prediction so the any threshold >0 should produce perfect result:
D1$threshold.pred1 <- ifelse(D1$pred > 0.6, 1, 0)
# I will generate a new table where directly compares the prediciton and the actual result:
t1 <- table(D1$level.up, D1$threshold.pred1)
#     0   1
#  0 600   0
#  1   0 400
#Now generate three diagnostics:

D1$accuracy.model1 <- (600+400)/1000

D1$precision.model1 <- 400/(400 + 0)

D1$recall.model1 <- 400/(400 + 0)

#Finally, calculate Kappa for your model according to:

#Convert to matrix
matrix1 <- as.matrix(t1)

#Calculate kappa
kappa(matrix1, exact = TRUE)/kappa(matrix1)
#1.153846

```

```{r}
#Now I will do the threshold for the second prediction model and the diagnostic metrics
D1$threshold.pred2 <- ifelse(D1$pred2 > 0.6, 1, 0)
# I will generate a new table where directly compares the prediciton and the actual result:
t2 <- table(D1$level.up, D1$threshold.pred2)
#     0   1
#  0 563  37
#  1  33 367
#Now generate three diagnostics:

D1$accuracy.model2 <- (563+367)/(563+37+33+367)
#0.93
D1$precision.model2 <- 367/(367 + 33)
#0.9175
D1$recall.model2 <- 563/(563 + 33)
#0.9446309

#Calculate Kappa for your model according to:
#Convert to matrix
matrix2 <- as.matrix(t2)

#Calculate kappa
kappa(matrix1, exact = TRUE)/kappa(matrix1)
#1.089442

# In our case, we are more concerned about false positive than false negative,b ecause our goal is to improve the passing rate, so to identify who is going to fail is like the most important part I think. So precision is more imporatnt than recall.
